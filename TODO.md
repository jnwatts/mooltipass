About
=====
This is my WIP branch for (re)implementing strings in bundle.img

Warning
=======
NOTE: This is *NOT* a chronological branch. The refs in this branch are *NOT* stable. I *WILL* be regularly rewriting this history of this branch to present a clean patch set.

Todo
====
- Update bitmaps/README
- FW bundle version detection
- Update plugin to match new file ids
- Add summary to end of bundle.py operation?
- Allow resources.py to "reserve" certain number of entries in section? Special entry, or just say "call it reserved_type_N"?
